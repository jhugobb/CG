We implemented Sokoban, a game firstly created in 1982, but now in 3.

Wikipedia game description:

The game is played on a board of squares, where each square is a floor or a wall. Some floor squares contain boxes, and some floor squares are marked as storage locations.
The player is confined to the board, and may move horizontally or vertically onto empty squares (never through walls or boxes). The player can also move into a box, which pushes it into the square beyond. Boxes may not be pushed into other boxes or walls, and they cannot be pulled. The number of boxes is equal to the number of storage locations. The puzzle is solved when all boxes are at storage locations.

Instructions:
-Move with 'w' (forward) and 's' (backwards).
-Rotate the character with 'a' and 'd'.
-Move the camera with by pressing the screen with the mouse and moving it.
-Zoom with the scroll wheel.
-Reset the level with 'r'.
-Press 'm' to go to the next level or 'n' to go to the previous.
-Press 'p' to change between 1st and 3st person modes.
-Press 't' to change between themes. (might take a bit to load)
