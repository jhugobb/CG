# CG
Project for the Computer Graphics course @ RUG

-We animated our cat model by at each frame adding one degree to each of its coordinates. After adding the program calcules the modulus by 360 (i.e.: if we reach the 398 degrees of rotation for example, we do 398 % 360 = 38).
-We implemented perspective controls (adws) to scroll the perspective in an espherical coordinate system, being the focus point the center of the sphere.  You can also zoom with '-' and '=', and pause the animation with 'space'.
