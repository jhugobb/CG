# CG
Project for the Computer Graphics course @ RUG

-We implemented perspective controls (adws) no scroll the perspective in a spherical coordinate system,
 being the focus point the center of the sphere.

- To have multiple animation, we refactored our code to be more generi and to support any kind of triangular mesh model
with any kind of texture associated with it. 

- We created an animation of Jupiter, rotating by itself, with 3 moons of different sizes and with different orbits,
moving at different speeds. 

- In the phong shading the light is not fixated, to give a sense of realism to the entire animation.
- In the gouraud shading, however, the light is fix in place, for to be able to see the dark parts of the rendered models.
