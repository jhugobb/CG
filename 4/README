Normal shader:
    -When not using the normal transformation matrix, the colors will be static from the model reference (i.e.: if the model is the cat, it's back will always be green independently from the scaling/rotation, because according to the model vertexes, it's back will be where the normals are closer to the (0, 1, 0) vector). When using the normal transformation matrix, the colors will be relative the transformations that ocurred to the model, therefore, the upper parts of the model (from our prespective) will always be green. In the case of the sphere, you nearly can't notice when it is rotating.
